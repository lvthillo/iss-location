# iss-location
The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. 
The ISS is traveling at 7.66 km/s or 27,600 km/h.

With this application you can track the current location of the ISS.
Define your [Google API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key) Key in `app.py`:
```
API_KEY = '<YOUR-API-KEY>'
```

Install the necessary modules:
```
$ pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3.6 app.py
```

The browser will open and show above which villages or cities the ISS is circulating.
